# https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/1679:
#  Internally R_system() calls system() which
# uses /bin/sh to launch various programs. If
# /bin/sh is called with LD_LIBRARY_PATH that
# loads condas shared libraries things break.
#  It may be that not setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# causes other things to break, in which case
# R_system() will need to be modified so that
# it calls execve() with an environment which
# has these modifications to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# removed which may be tricky to orchestrate
